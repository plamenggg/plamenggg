## Hi there, I`m Plamen 👋

### 🚀 Aspiring JavaScript Developer
I'm a motivated finance professional with strong market analysis, who's transitioned from trading to coding. Recently completing Telerik Academy’s JavaScript track, I’ve spent the last 6 months diving into Javascript and web development and now eager to apply problem-solving and programming skills in a Junior Developer role.

### 🔨 What I'm Working On:
- **JavaScript & React Development**: Currently deepening my skills by working on various projects that leverage React for dynamic web applications. I’m continuously learning and refining my understanding of JavaScript concepts to enhance my coding efficiency and project scalability.
- **Continuous Learning**: I am actively taking courses and tutorials to stay up-to-date with the latest best practices and frameworks in web development, particularly focusing on mastering JavaScript and front-end technologies.
